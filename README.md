Repo based on the frequency domain template from [this audio effect repo](https://github.com/juandagilc/Audio-Effects), the purpose is to try a whole bunch of goofy ideas and maybe do a plug-in using a selection of what works best. I'm also using a bunch of stuff from [this vscode/juce template](https://github.com/tomoyanonymous/juce_cmake_vscode_example).
